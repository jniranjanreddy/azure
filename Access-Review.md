In Azure, Access Review is a feature within Azure Active Directory (AAD) that allows organizations to periodically review and manage user access to resources, ensuring that only necessary permissions are granted and maintained over time. Access reviews are typically applied to groups, applications, and role assignments to improve security and compliance.

Why Access Review is Needed
Compliance Requirements: Many regulatory standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) require organizations to have strict access controls. Regular access reviews help meet these compliance standards by ensuring that permissions are correctly assigned.

Security: Access review minimizes the risk of unauthorized access, reducing security vulnerabilities from excessive permissions or orphaned accounts (e.g., accounts left active after an employee departs).

Cost Management: By managing who has access to premium resources, companies can optimize costs by restricting access to only those who need it, especially in pay-as-you-go services.

Operational Efficiency: Access reviews support operational efficiency by allowing administrators to verify whether users and groups still need access, making it easier to maintain accurate access control without manual intervention.

Pros of Access Review in Azure
Improved Security: Regular reviews prevent privilege creep, ensuring that only current employees with the necessary roles have access to sensitive data.
Compliance Assurance: Facilitates adherence to compliance standards by providing a clear audit trail of access reviews.
User-Friendly Interface: Azure provides a streamlined interface for configuring and managing reviews, making it easier for administrators and reviewers.
Automation and Efficiency: Access reviews can be scheduled automatically, reducing the manual work involved in maintaining access control.
Self-Service for End Users: Allows resource owners to participate in access reviews, empowering them to take responsibility for managing access to their resources.
Cons of Access Review in Azure
Complex Setup for Large Organizations: For companies with a large user base, setting up and managing access reviews can be complex and time-consuming.
Review Fatigue: Frequent access review prompts can lead to fatigue, resulting in reviewers possibly overlooking critical issues.
Limited Customization: Access review may lack specific customization features, making it challenging to adapt reviews for unique organizational needs.
Dependency on Azure AD Premium: Access review is a feature of Azure AD Premium P2; organizations without this subscription level cannot access it.
In summary, Azure Access Review is essential for maintaining a secure, compliant, and cost-effective Azure environment, but it requires careful planning and appropriate subscription levels to use effectively.
