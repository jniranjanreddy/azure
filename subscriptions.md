#0969DA Azure Subscriptions are a logical unit of Azure services that are linked to an Azure account. In order to take advantage of Azureâ€™s cloud-based services, 
you must have a subscription as it serves as a single billing unit for Azure resources used in that account.

```
An Azure subscription is linked to a single account, the one that was used to create the subscription and is used for billing purposes. 
Within the subscription, resources can be provisioned as instances of the many Azure products and services.
You can have more than one subscription, often for billing purposes, since each subscription generates its own set of billing reports and invoices.
The person who creates an Azure subscription becomes the global administrator for that subscription and has full access to every aspect of that subscription
hence separate subscriptions can also be a way to create a division of responsibility for Azure services.

```
