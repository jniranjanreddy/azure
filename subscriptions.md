 Azure Subscriptions are a logical unit of Azure services that are linked to an Azure account. In order to take advantage of Azure’s cloud-based services, 
you must have a subscription as it serves as a single billing unit for Azure resources used in that account.


An Azure subscription is linked to a single account, the one that was used to create the subscription and is used for billing purposes. 
Within the subscription, resources can be provisioned as instances of the many Azure products and services.
You can have more than one subscription, often for billing purposes, since each subscription generates its own set of billing reports and invoices.
The person who creates an Azure subscription becomes the global administrator for that subscription and has full access to every aspect of that subscription
hence separate subscriptions can also be a way to create a division of responsibility for Azure services.

*Types of subscriptions
```
There are several ways to create a subscription with Microsoft Azure; I will attempt to highlight the most common. A comprehensive list of subscription types may be seen on the Microsoft Azure Offer Details webpage.

A Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA) is a large-scale licence agreement with Microsoft. The Enterprise Agreement is a three-year contract with Microsoft most commonly found in giant enterprises with 500 or more users. One of the most prevalent sorts of subscriptions is the EA. See also Enterprise Dev/Test, which gives you the same access as an Enterprise Agreement but at a lower cost for development and testing workloads.
Pay-as-you-go — The second most popular subscription option is pay-as-you-go. In most cases, the company will keep a credit card file. A client may, on rare occasions, pay via invoice.
Free Trial — Anyone may join up for a 30-day Azure Free Trial. A $200 Azure spend credit is included in the free trial membership. Once a payment card is on file, a free trial becomes a paid trial.
CSP stands for Cloud Solutions Partner, and subscriptions to CSP are acquired through a Microsoft partner.
